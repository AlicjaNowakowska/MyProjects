# MyThesis
This project aims to investigate the disease diffusion process. It consists of three parts: 
-> Data set of the contacts between people that is used for the investigation and proceeds from the SocioPatterns website.
-> Thesis that describes all work that was done.
-> The code files (every file is assigned to the chpater of the thesis).

The steps of the project:
1) Creation of the network on the basis of the data set.
2) Simulation of the disease difussion process on the network.
3) Analysis of the results. The following questions are tried to be answered:
What is the range of the disease spread?
Who can cause the epidemic?
What factors influence on the disease dynamics?
The methods used to answer them:
-> histograms of the distribution
-> visulization of the network and analysis of its characteristics
-> analysis of the individual node characteristics (centrality measures, number of contacts)
-> formulation of the Regression model (models with one variables, models with many variables, elimination of the multicollinearity,
model comparison, model validation and data transformations)
